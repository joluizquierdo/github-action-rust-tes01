Oxidize your GitHub Actions with Rust! This repository provides a template for
creating GitHub Actions using Rust, allowing you to leverage Rust's performance
and safety features in your CI/CD workflows.

## Usage

To use this template, simply click the "Use this template" button on the GitHub
page and create a new repository based on it. Optionally, you can clone the
repository.

Once you have your repository in place, you need to fill the configuration file
called `config.yaml` located in the root directory.

Finally, generate the template files by running the following command:

```bash
cargo run --example generate
```
